 Publish or Perish is the name for the research and creation project that Silvio Lorusso and Stef Kors, on behalf of the PublishingLab of Amsterdam, have developed for Foto Colectania. This commission has materialized in a free online digital content publishing web/app with the capacity to publish both images and texts.

 The work was presented in Barcelona during a Printing Party at Foto Colectania as part of the DONE3 festival.<div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div>Artificial Intelligence never has a headache</div><div><a href="https://www.oneacre.online/?id=karina-stef-D1541252022930" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">oneacre.online</a></div></div><div><div>The publication imagines a possible future format for tech related theory which — with the constant updates of technology— tend to see the edge of obsolescence straight out of the publisher’s door.

The framework for erasure is drawn from a critique of accelerationism, the video game Katamari Damacy, and internet aesthetics. It begins by investigating power relations in dominant archival practices, before tracing how memory storage technology (from the written word to the internet) reinforces hierarchical models of knowledge, and finally posing the generative potential of erasure in alternative models of knowing, doing, and being. It does so by locating strategies of erasure in audio, visual, and digital cultures in the forms of: erasure/forgetting, translation/mutation, and recontextualizing/remythologizing. oneacre.online had a small feature in the Sonic Acts Academy book.<div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div>Textual and morphological observation of comments sections</div><div><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a></div></div><div><div>This zine is a series that exist out of the four parts: Texts, Taxonomy, Specimens &amp; Community Guidelines.
