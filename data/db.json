    "Description": "Poetics and Politics of Erasure is a multidisciplinary essay on the aesthetics and politics of erasure. The framework for erasure is drawn from a critique of accelerationism, the video game Katamari Damacy, and internet aesthetics. It begins by investigating power relations in dominant archival practices, before tracing how memory storage technology (from the written word to the internet) reinforces hierarchical models of knowledge, and finally posing the generative potential of erasure in alternative models of knowing, doing, and being. It does so by locating strategies of erasure in audio, visual, and digital cultures in the forms of: erasure/forgetting, translation/mutation, and recontextualizing/remythologizing. oneacre.online had a small feature in the Sonic Acts Academy book.",
